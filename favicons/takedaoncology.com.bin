The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving a response, which was defined as the absence of phlebotomy eligibility.\n*   The first key secondary endpoint, which is the pre-specified primary endpoint for European Union (EU) regulators, was also met, with a mean of 0.5 phlebotomies per patient in the rusfertide arm compared to 1.8 phlebotomies per patient in the placebo arm during weeks 0-32; p\u003c0.0001.\n*   The other three pre-specified key secondary endpoints, namely hematocrit control\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e and patient-reported outcomes using PROMIS Fatigue SF-8a\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e and MFSAF TSS-7\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e, were also achieved with statistical significance.\n*   Rusfertide was generally well tolerated in the Phase 3 VERIFY trial, and safety was in line with previous rusfertide clinical studies. No new safety findings were observed in the study. The majority of adverse events were grade 1-2 injection site reactions and all serious adverse events reported were deemed to be not drug related. There was no evidence of an increased risk of cancer in rusfertide-treated patients compared to those on placebo.\n\n“The positive results of the Phase 3 VERIFY study across the primary and all key secondary endpoints provide compelling evidence of the potential for rusfertide as a first-in-class erythrocytosis-specific agent to address unmet medical needs in patients with PV who are unable to achieve adequate hematocrit control despite standard of care treatments,” said Arturo Molina, M.D., M.S., Chief Medical Officer of Protagonist. “We plan to submit additional details of these promising results for presentation at upcoming medical conferences in 2025. We are immensely grateful to the patients, study staff and principal investigators who made the VERIFY study possible.”\n\nPatients with PV are at increased risk for life-threatening cardiovascular and thrombotic events. Many patients with PV require regular phlebotomy, a process of removing blood to manage elevated hematocrit levels caused by an excess of red blood cells, as well as treatment with cytoreductive therapies. Phlebotomy can be burdensome and exacerbate symptoms, including severe fatigue, visual disturbances and iron deficiency, which impact patients’ quality of life. The reduction of hematocrit below 45% is a primary treatment goal for patients with PV as recommended by current treatment guidelines.\n\n“We are encouraged by these results and excited about the potential of rusfertide to help patients living with PV. These patients may experience a high treatment burden, and severe symptoms can impact their quality of life,” said Andy Plump, M.D., Ph.D., President of R\\\u0026D at Takeda. “We are deeply committed to bringing additional treatment options to those living with blood cancers, including myeloid cancers such as PV.”\n\n“The totality of impressive clinical data to date shows that rusfertide has the potential for meaningful positive impact on the lives of patients with PV,” said Dinesh V. Patel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Protagonist. “We look forward to working with our partner, Takeda, to submit our findings to the regulatory agencies. Today’s study results also mark a critical inflection point in Protagonist’s decade long journey in the hepcidin program and further validates our platform and expertise in innovating highly differentiated peptide-based medicines to fulfill unmet medical needs.”\n\nUnder the license and collaboration agreement between Protagonist and Takeda, Protagonist earns a $25 million milestone payment following these positive results. The milestone is payable following completion of the VERIFY clinical study report.\n\nThe impact on Takeda’s financial results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 (FY2024), following the study results, is immaterial.\n\nProtagonist will host a conference call and webcast, for which details can be found below.\n\n## Protagonist Investor Conference Call and Webcast Details\n\nThe dial-in numbers for Protagonist’s investor update on Monday, March 3rd at 8:30 am ET are:\n\n*   US-based Investors: 1-877-300-8521\n*   International Investors: 1-412-317-6026\n*   Conference Call ID: 1793905\n\nThe webcast link for the event can be found here: \u003chttps://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1708360\u0026tp_key=94f2832555\u003e\n\nA replay of the presentation will be available on the Protagonist Investor Relations Events and Presentations webpage following the event.\n\n## About VERIFY\n\nThe Phase 3 VERIFY trial (NCT05210790) is an ongoing, three-part, global, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating rusfertide in 293 patients with polycythemia vera over a 156-week period. The trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-weekly, subcutaneously self-administered rusfertide in patients with uncontrolled hematocrit who are phlebotomy dependent despite standard of care treatment, which could include hydroxyurea, interferon and/or ruxolitinib. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving a response during weeks 20-32, which was defined as the absence of “phlebotomy eligibility.” To meet phlebotomy eligibility, patients in the study were required to have: confirmed hematocrit ≥45% that was ≥3% higher than their baseline hematocrit value, or hematocrit ≥48%.\n\nAll patients have completed their participation in the randomized, placebo-controlled portion of the trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of rusfertide plus current treatment versus placebo plus current treatment and are now in the open-label portions of the trial.\n\n## About Protagonist\n\nProtagonist Therapeutics is a discovery through late-stage development biopharmaceutical company. Two novel peptides derived from Protagonist's proprietary discovery platform are currently in advanced Phase 3 clinical development, with New Drug Application submissions to the FDA expected in 2025. Icotrokinra (formerly, JNJ-2113) is a first-in-class investigational targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the Interleukin-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) which is licensed to JNJ Innovative Medicines (“JNJ”), formerly Janssen Biotech, Inc. Following icotrokinra's joint discovery by Protagonist and JNJ scientists pursuant to the companies' IL-23R collaboration, Protagonist was primarily responsible for development of icotrokinra through Phase 1, with JNJ assuming responsibility for development in Phase 2 and beyond. Rusfertide, a mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, is currently in Phase 3 development for the rare blood disorder polycythemia vera (PV). Rusfertide is being co-developed and will be co-commercialized with Takeda Pharmaceuticals pursuant to a worldwide collaboration and license agreement entered into in 2024 under which the Company remains primarily responsible for development through NDA filing. The Company also has a number of pre-clinical stage oral drug discovery programs addressing clinically and commercially validated targets, including IL-17 oral peptide antagonist PN-881, oral hepcidin program, and oral obesity program.\n\nMore information on Protagonist, its pipeline drug candidates and clinical studies can be found on the Company's website at [www.protagonist-inc.com](https://www.protagonist-inc.com/).\n\n## About Takeda\n\nTakeda is focused on creating better health for people and a brighter future for the world.

(Nasdaq: KROS) to further develop, manufacture and commercialize elritercept worldwide outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. \n\nElritercept is a late-stage investigational activin inhibitor designed to treat anemia associated with certain hematologic cancers, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelofibrosis (MF). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the development of elritercept for very low-, low- and intermediate-risk MDS. MDS and MF are characterized by inadequate blood cell production, often leading to severe anemia that significantly impacts patient health and quality of life. Elritercept targets activin A and B proteins, which are believed to play a crucial role in anemia-associated diseases. In early clinical studies, elritercept has shown promising clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with very low-, low- and intermediate-risk MDS as a monotherapy and in patients with MF in combination with standard of care.\n\n“Elritercept has the potential to make a meaningful difference for patients with blood cancers, one of our key areas of strategic focus,” said Teresa Bitetti, President of the Global Oncology Business Unit at Takeda. “The addition of elritercept further bolsters our oncology pipeline and introduces a potential future growth driver for Takeda. I am excited to further advance the pioneering work begun by the Keros Therapeutics team with the goal of delivering this potential treatment option to patients.” \n\nElritercept is currently in two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials; one in patients with very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS and one in patients with MF. The Phase 3 RENEW trial evaluating elritercept in adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia with very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS will begin enrollment soon. Takeda plans to evaluate elritercept in these cancers across patient segments and lines of therapy.\n\n“We are excited to partner with Takeda, whose global reach and expertise in oncology and hematology will help unlock elritercept’s potential for patients with MDS and MF,” said Jasbir S. Seehra, Ph.D., Chair and Chief Executive Officer at Keros Therapeutics. “With a differentiated mechanism of action targeting a broad range of pathways in blood cell production, elritercept has shown promise for patients who have not responded to standard therapies. This collaboration will accelerate development of elritercept for patients in need and offer new insights into these complex hematologic conditions.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Takeda will receive an exclusive worldwide license to further develop, manufacture and commercialize elritercept in all indications and territories outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Takeda will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization as of the effective date of the agreement. Takeda will provide Keros Therapeutics with an upfront payment of $200 million and potential payments relating to regulatory, development and commercial sales milestones, as well as royalties on net sales. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of antitrust reviews.\n\n## About  Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of diverse blood cancers in which the bone marrow fails to produce enough healthy blood cells. MDS is among the most common hematologic malignancies, with approximately 20,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e Most people with MDS experience anemia, or low red blood cell counts, which impacts quality of life and mortality.\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e 75% of people living with MDS have low-risk MDS, with a median survival of approximately three to 10 years.\u003csup\u003e3,4\u003c/sup\u003e Many low-risk MDS patients require frequent red blood cell transfusions, which can increase over time and negatively impact quality of life.\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e Despite advances, additional therapeutic options are needed to improve quality of life and anemia symptoms for patients with low-risk MDS, particularly those whose disease is ringed sideroblast-negative or who have a high transfusion need.\n\n## About  Myelofibrosis (MF)\nMyelofibrosis (MF) is a rare and life-threatening blood cancer characterized by the buildup of scar tissue in the bone marrow, which impairs its ability to produce normal blood cells. In the United States, approximately 3,000 new cases of MF are diagnosed each year.\u003csup\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e Patients with MF often experience anemia, enlarged spleen and other symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. Although standard treatments can reduce spleen size and improve symptoms, they may exacerbate anemia and lead to low platelet counts. \n\n## About  Elritercept\nElritercept is an investigational, potentially best-in-class activin inhibitor, targeting both activin A and activin B proteins, which are believed to play a crucial role in anemia-associated diseases. Elritercept is currently in two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials; one in patients with very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS and one in patients with MF. The Phase 3 RENEW trial evaluating elritercept in adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia with very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS will begin enrollment soon. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the development of elritercept for this condition. \n\n## About  Takeda\nTakeda is focused on creating better health for people and a brighter future for the world.

ICLUSIG is a targeted cancer medicine developed using a computational and structure-based drug-design platform, specifically designed to inhibit the activity of BCR::ABL1 and its mutations. ICLUSIG inhibits native BCR::ABL1, as well as all BCR::ABL1 treatment-resistant mutations, including the most resistant T315I mutation. This mutation has been associated with resistance to all other approved TKIs. ICLUSIG received full approval from the FDA in November 2016. ICLUSIG is currently indicated in the U.S. for adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission (CR) at the end of induction. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In addition, it is approved as monotherapy in Ph+ ALL for whom no other kinase inhibitors are indicated or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL, chronic-phase (CP) CML with resistance or intolerance to at least two prior kinase inhibitors, accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML for whom no other kinase inhibitors are indicated, or T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase). ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.\n\n### IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px;\"\u003e\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWARNING: ARTERIAL OCCLUSIVE EVENTS, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eSee full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eArterial occlusive events (AOEs), including fatalities, have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients.

These included cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events. In PhALLCON, 6% of 163 patients experienced AOEs; 3.7% experienced Grade 3 or 4. The incidence of AOEs in OPTIC (45 mg → 15 mg) was 14% of 94 patients; 6% experienced Grade 3 or 4. In PACE, the incidence of AOEs was 26% of 449 patients; 14% experienced Grade 3 or 4. Fatal AOEs occurred in 0.6% of patients in PhALLCON, 2.1% of patients in OPTIC, and in 2% of patients in PACE. Some patients in PACE experienced recurrent or multisite vascular occlusion. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. The most common risk factors observed with these events in PACE were history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and non-ischemic cardiac disease. In PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE, AOEs were more frequent with increasing age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\nIn PhALLCON, patients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or diabetes were excluded. Patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, venous thromboembolism, clinically significant atrial/ventricular tachyarrhythmias, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 6 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were also excluded.\n\nIn OPTIC, patients with uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease were excluded. \n\nIn PACE, patients with uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and patients with clinically significant or active cardiovascular disease within the 3 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG were excluded. \n\nConsider whether the benefits of ICLUSIG are expected to exceed the risks. Monitor for evidence of AOEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Consider benefit-risk to guide a decision to restart ICLUSIG.\n\n**Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs):** Serious or severe VTEs have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PhALLCON, VTEs occurred in 12% of 163 patients, including serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 3.1% of patients.  One of 94 patients in OPTIC experienced a VTE (Grade 1 retinal vein occlusion). In PACE, VTEs occurred in 6% of 449 patients including serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) VTEs in 5.8% of patients. In PhALLCON and PACE VTEs included deep venous thrombosis, embolism, pulmonary embolism, superficial vein thrombosis, thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal vein thrombosis with vision loss. The incidence of VTEs in PACE was higher in patients with Ph+ ALL (9% of 32 patients) and BP-CML (10% of 62 patients). Monitor for evidence of VTEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.\n\n**Heart Failure:** Fatal, serious or severe heart failure events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PhALLCON, heart failure occurred in 6% of 163 patients; 1.2% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) heart failure. Heart failure occurred in 13% of 94 patients in OPTIC; 1.1% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4). In PACE, heart failure occurred in 9% of 449 patients; 7% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or higher).  In PhALLCON the most frequently reported heart failure event (\u003e1 patient) was increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (2.5%). In OPTIC, the most frequently reported heart failure events (\u003e1 patient each) were left ventricular hypertrophy (3.2%) and BNP increased (3.2%). In PACE, the most frequently reported heart failure events (≥2%) were congestive cardiac failure (3.1%), decreased ejection fraction (2.9%), and cardiac failure (2%). Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and manage heart failure as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG for new or worsening heart failure.\n\n**Hepatotoxicity:** ICLUSIG can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in 3 patients, with hepatic failure occurring within 1 week of starting ICLUSIG in one of these patients. These fatal cases occurred in patients with BP-CML or Ph+ ALL treated with monotherapy. Hepatotoxicity occurred in 66% of 163 patients in PhALLCON, in 28% of 94 patients in OPTIC and in 32% of 449 patients in PACE. Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity occurred in PhALLCON (30% of 163 patients), in OPTIC (6% of 94 patients), and in PACE (13% of 449 patients). The most frequent hepatotoxic events were elevations of ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at a reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.\n\n**Hypertension:** Serious or severe hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Monitor blood pressure at baseline and as clinically indicated and manage hypertension as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop ICLUSIG if hypertension is not medically controlled. For significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt ICLUSIG and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis.\n\n**Pancreatitis:** Serious or severe pancreatitis has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Elevations of lipase and amylase also occurred. In the majority of cases that led to dose modification or treatment discontinuation, pancreatitis resolved within 2-3 weeks. Monitor serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity. Evaluate for pancreatitis when lipase elevation is accompanied by abdominal symptoms.\n\n**Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML:** In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with CP-CML, single agent ICLUSIG 45 mg once daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the ICLUSIG arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib-treated patients, ICLUSIG-treated patients exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.\n\n**Neuropathy:** Peripheral and cranial neuropathy occurred in patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. Some of these events in PhALLCON and PACE were Grade 3 or 4. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.\n\n**Ocular Toxicity:** Serious or severe ocular toxicity leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. The most frequent ocular toxicities occurring in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE were dry eye, blurred vision, and eye pain. Retinal toxicities included age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment.\n\n**Hemorrhage:** Fatal and serious hemorrhage events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Fatal hemorrhages occurred in PACE and serious hemorrhages occurred in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. In PACE, the incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most frequently reported serious hemorrhages. Events often occurred in patients with Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Monitor for hemorrhage and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.\n\n**Fluid Retention:** Fatal and serious fluid retention events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PACE, one instance of brain edema was fatal and serious events included pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and angioedema. In PhALLCON serious fluid retention included pericardial effusion. The most frequent occurrences of fluid retention in patients who received ICLUSIG were peripheral edema and pleural effusion. Monitor for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.\n\n**Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular, atrial arrhythmias, tachycardia, syncope, atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia occurred in patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC, and PACE. For some patients, events were serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) and led to hospitalization. Monitor for signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness) and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.\n \n**Myelosuppression:** Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. In PACE, the incidence of myelosuppression was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL treated with monotherapy than in patients with CP-CML. Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated. If ANC less than 1 x 10\u003csup\u003e9\u003c/sup\u003e/L or platelets less than 50 x 10\u003csup\u003e9\u003c/sup\u003e/L, interrupt ICLUSIG until ANC at least 1.5 x 10\u003csup\u003e9\u003c/sup\u003e/L and platelets at least 75 x 10\u003csup\u003e9\u003c/sup\u003e/L, then resume at same or reduced dose.\n\n**Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):** Serious TLS was reported in ICLUSIG-treated patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. Ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating ICLUSIG.\n\n**Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):** RPLS (also known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been reported in patients who received ICLUSIG. Patients may present with neurological signs and symptoms, visual disturbances, and hypertension. Diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Interrupt ICLUSIG until resolution. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG in patients upon resolution of RPLS is unknown.\n\n**Impaired Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation:** Impaired wound healing occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Withhold ICLUSIG for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Permanently discontinue in patients with gastrointestinal perforation.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:** Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, ICLUSIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 3 weeks after the last dose.\n\n### ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u003e20% of patients) are:\n\n* ICLUSIG as a single agent: rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, dry skin, hypertension, fatigue, fluid retention and edema, pyrexia, nausea, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, hemorrhage, anemia, hepatic dysfunction and AOEs. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u003e20%) are platelet count decreased, neutrophil cell count decreased, and white blood cell decreased.\n\n* ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy: hepatic dysfunction, arthralgia, rash and related conditions, headache, pyrexia, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, hypertension, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, neuropathy peripheral, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, fluid retention and edema, vomiting, paresthesia and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u003e20%) are decreased white blood cell count, decreased neutrophil cell count, decreased platelet count, decreased lymphocyte cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased lipase and increased alanine aminotransferase.\n\n \n**To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals at 1-844-817-6468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program)**.\n\n\u003ch3\u003eDRUG INTERACTIONS\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n**Strong CYP3A Inhibitors:** Avoid coadministration or reduce ICLUSIG dose if coadministration cannot be avoided.\n\n**Strong CYP3A Inducers:** Avoid coadministration.\n \n### USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\n**Lactation:** Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 1 week following last dose.\n \n**Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:** Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ICLUSIG.\nPonatinib may impair fertility in females, and it is not known if these effects are reversible. \n \n**Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with CP-CML, AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL receiving monotherapy, reduce the starting dose of ICLUSIG to 30mg orally once daily for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment as these patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions compared to patients with normal hepatic function. For patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, no dosage adjustment is recommended.\n\n[**Prescribing Information**](https://www.iclusig.com/sites/default/files/2023-02/iclusig-prescribing-information.pdf)\n\n## About ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin)\n\nADCETRIS is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), utilizing Pfizer’s proprietary technology. The ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-positive tumor cells.\n\nADCETRIS injection for intravenous infusion has received FDA approval for seven indications: \n\n* Adult patients with previously untreated Stage III/IV classical Hodkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (2018)\n* Pediatric patients 2 years and older with previously untreated high risk cHL in combination with doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone and cyclophosphamide (2022)\n* Adult patients with cHL at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation (2015)\n* Adult patients with cHL after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates (2011)\n* Adult patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified, in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (2018)\n* Adult patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen (2011)\n* Adult patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) after prior systemic therapy (2017)\n\nHealth Canada granted ADCETRIS approval with conditions for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL in 2013, and non-conditional approval for post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) consolidation treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients at increased risk of relapse or progression in 2017, adults with pcALCL or CD30-expressing MF who have had prior systemic therapy in 2018, for previously untreated Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in 2019, and for previously untreated adult patients with sALCL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), whose tumors express CD30, in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone in 2019.\n\nADCETRIS received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission in October 2012, and the specific obligations of the conditional marketing authorization were fulfilled in May 2022. The approved indications in the European Union are: (1) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CD30-positive Stage III \u0026 IV Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD), (2) for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT, (3) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option, (4) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL, (5) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated sALCL in combination with CHP and (6) for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least one prior systemic therapy.\n\nADCETRIS has received marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in more than 70 countries for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL. See Important Safety Information below.\n\nADCETRIS is being evaluated broadly in more than 70 clinical trials, including a Phase 3 study in first-line Hodgkin lymphoma (ECHELON-1) and another Phase 3 study in first-line CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (ECHELON-2), as well as trials in many additional types of CD30-positive malignancies.\n\nPfizer and Takeda fund joint development costs for ADCETRIS on a 50:50 basis, except in Japan where Takeda is solely responsible for development costs. \n\n### ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) Important Safety Information (European Union)\n\nPlease refer to Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.\n\n### Contraindications\n\nADCETRIS is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to brentuximab vedotin and its excipients. In addition, combined use of ADCETRIS with bleomycin causes pulmonary toxicity.\n\n### Special Warnings and Precautions\n\n**Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):** John Cunningham virus (JCV) reactivation resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death can occur in patients treated with ADCETRIS. PML has been reported in patients who received ADCETRIS after receiving multiple prior chemotherapy regimens. PML is a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that results from reactivation of latent JCV and is often fatal.\n\nClosely monitor patients for new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms, which may be suggestive of PML. Suggested evaluation of PML includes neurology consultation, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JCV DNA by polymerase chain reaction or a brain biopsy with evidence of JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established. Hold dosing for any suspected case of PML and permanently discontinue ADCETRIS if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed.\n\nBe alert to PML symptoms that the patient may not notice (e.g., cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric symptoms).\n\n**Pancreatitis:** Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Fatal outcomes have been reported. Closely monitor patients for new or worsening abdominal pain, which may be suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Patient evaluation may include physical examination, laboratory evaluation for serum amylase and serum lipase, and abdominal imaging, such as ultrasound and other appropriate diagnostic measures. Hold ADCETRIS for any suspected case of acute pancreatitis. ADCETRIS should be discontinued if a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed.\n\n**Pulmonary Toxicity:** Cases of pulmonary toxicity, some with fatal outcomes, including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been reported in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Although a causal association with ADCETRIS has not been established, the risk of pulmonary toxicity cannot be ruled out. Promptly evaluate and treat new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnea) appropriately. Consider holding dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.\n\n**Serious infections and opportunistic infections:** Serious infections such as pneumonia, staphylococcal bacteremia, sepsis/septic shock (including fatal outcomes), and herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (reactivation) and opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and oral candidiasis have been reported in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment for the emergence of possible serious and opportunistic infections.\n\n**Infusion-related reactions (IRR):** Immediate and delayed IRR, as well as anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADCETRIS. Carefully monitor patients during and after an infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue administration of ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. If an IRR occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. The infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after symptom resolution. Patients who have experienced a prior IRR should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. IRRs are more frequent and more severe in patients with antibodies to ADCETRIS.\n\n**Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS):** TLS has been reported with ADCETRIS. Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden are at risk of TLS. Monitor these patients closely and manage according to best medical practice.\n\n**Peripheral neuropathy (PN):** ADCETRIS treatment may cause PN, both sensory and motor. ADCETRIS-induced PN is typically an effect of cumulative exposure to ADCETRIS and is reversible in most cases. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening PN may require a delay and a dose reduction or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.\n\n**Hematological toxicities:** Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged (equal to or greater than one week) Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia can occur with ADCETRIS. Monitor complete blood counts prior to administration of each dose.\n\n**Febrile neutropenia:** Febrile neutropenia has been reported with ADCETRIS. Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to administration of each dose of treatment. Closely monitor patients for fever and manage according to best medical practice if febrile neutropenia develops.\n\nWhen ADCETRIS is administered in combination with AVD or CHP, primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended for all patients beginning with the first dose.\n\n**Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs):** Cases of SCARs, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with ADCETRIS. Fatal outcomes have been reported for SJS and TEN. If SJS, TEN or DRESS occur, ADCETRIS should be discontinued, and appropriate medical therapy should be administered.\n\n**Gastrointestinal (GI) Complications:** GI complications, some with fatal outcomes, including intestinal obstruction, ileus, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, erosion, ulcer, perforation and hemorrhage, have been reported with ADCETRIS. Promptly evaluate and treat patients if new or worsening GI symptoms occur.\n\n**Hepatotoxicity:** Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been reported with ADCETRIS. Serious cases of hepatotoxicity, including fatal outcomes, have also occurred. Pre-existing liver disease, comorbidities, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Test liver function prior to treatment initiation and routinely monitor during treatment. Patients experiencing hepatotoxicity may require a delay, dose modification, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.\n\n**Hyperglycemia:** Hyperglycemia has been reported during trials in patients with an elevated body mass index (BMI) with or without a history of diabetes mellitus. Closely monitor serum glucose for patients who experience an event of hyperglycemia. Administer anti-diabetic treatment as appropriate.\n\n**Infusion site extravasation:** Extravasation during intravenous infusion has occurred. Given the possibility of extravasation, it is recommended to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.\n\n**Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** There is limited experience in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Available data indicate that MMAE clearance might be affected by severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and by low serum albumin concentrations.\n\n**CD30+ CTCL:** The size of the treatment effect in CD30 + CTCL subtypes other than mycosis fungoides (MF) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) is not clear due to lack of high level evidence. In two single arm phase II studies of ADCETRIS, disease activity has been shown in the subtypes Sézary syndrome (SS), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and mixed CTCL histology. These data suggest that efficacy and safety can be extrapolated to other CTCL CD30+ subtypes. Carefully consider the benefit-risk per patient and use with caution in other CD30+ CTCL patient types.\n\n**Sodium content in excipients:** This medicinal product contains 13.2 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\n\n**Traceability:** In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\n### INTERACTIONS\n\nPatients who are receiving a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, concomitantly with ADCETRIS may have an increased risk of neutropenia. If neutropenia develops, refer to dosing recommendations for neutropenia (see SmPC section 4.2). Co-administration of ADCETRIS with a CYP3A4 inducer did not alter the plasma exposure of ADCETRIS, but it appeared to reduce plasma concentrations of MMAE metabolites that could be assayed. ADCETRIS is not expected to alter the exposure to drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.\n\n**PREGNANCY:** Advise women of childbearing potential to use two methods of effective contraception during treatment with ADCETRIS and until 6 months after treatment. There are no data from the use of ADCETRIS in pregnant women, although studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Do not use ADCETRIS during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.\n\n**LACTATION (breast-feeding):** There are no data as to whether ADCETRIS or its metabolites are excreted in human milk, therefore a risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from this therapy, taking into account a potential risk of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\n**FERTILITY:** In non-clinical studies, brentuximab vedotin treatment has resulted in testicular toxicity, and may alter male fertility. MMAE has been shown to have anagenic properties. Therefore, men being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before treatment. Men being treated with this medicine are advised not to father a child during treatment and for up to 6 months following the last dose.\n\n**Effects on ability to drive and use machines**: ADCETRIS may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n### UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS\n\n**Monotherapy:** The most frequent adverse reactions (≥10%) were infections, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, neutropenia, rash, cough, vomiting, arthralgia, peripheral motor neuropathy, infusion-related reactions, pruritus, constipation, dyspnea, weight decreased, myalgia and abdominal pain. Serious adverse drug reactions occurred in 12% of patients. The frequency of unique serious adverse drug reactions was ≤1%. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 24% of patients.\n\n**Combination Therapy:** In the studies of ADCETRIS as combination therapy in 662 patients with previously untreated advanced HL (C25003) and 223 patients with previously untreated CD30+ PTCL, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were: infections, neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, constipation, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, alopecia, anemia, weight decreased, stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, insomnia, bone pain, rash, cough, dyspnea, arthralgia, myalgia, back pain, peripheral motor neuropathy, upper respiratory tract infection, and dizziness. In patients receiving ADCETRIS combination therapy, serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3% of patients included febrile neutropenia (15%), pyrexia (5%), and neutropenia (3%). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients. \n\n**ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin) for injection U.S. Important Safety Information**\n\n**BOXED WARNING**\n\n**PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML): JC virus infection resulting in PML, and death can occur in ADCETRIS-treated patients.**\n\n### CONTRAINDICATION\n\nContraindicated with concomitant bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity (e.g., interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation).\n\n### WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n**Peripheral neuropathy (PN):** ADCETRIS causes PN that is predominantly sensory. Cases of motor PN have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced PN is cumulative. Monitor for symptoms such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening PN may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.\n\n**Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions:** Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If an IRR occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapy. Premedicate patients with a prior IRR before subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.\n\n**Hematologic toxicities:** Fatal and serious cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported with ADCETRIS. Prolonged (≥1 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS.\n\nAdminister G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1 for adult patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated Stage III/IV cHL or previously untreated PTCL, and pediatric patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated high risk cHL.\n\nMonitor complete blood counts prior to each ADCETRIS dose. Monitor more frequently for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent doses.\n\n**Serious infections and opportunistic infections:** Infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Closely monitor patients during treatment for infections.\n\n**Tumor lysis syndrome:** Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden may be at increased risk. Monitor closely and take appropriate measures.\n\n**Increased toxicity in the presence of severe renal impairment:** The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment. Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\n**Increased toxicity in the presence of moderate or severe hepatic impairment:** The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Avoid use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\n\n**Hepatotoxicity:** Fatal and serious cases have occurred in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin, and occurred after the first ADCETRIS dose or rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients with new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.\n\n**PML:** Fatal cases of JC virus infection resulting in PML have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider PML diagnosis in patients with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS if PML is suspected and discontinue ADCETRIS if PML is confirmed.\n\n**Pulmonary toxicity:** Fatal and serious events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity, including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.\n\n**Serious dermatologic reactions:** Fatal and serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.\n\n**Gastrointestinal (GI) complications:** Fatal and serious cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported. Other fatal and serious GI complications include perforation, hemorrhage, erosion, ulcer, intestinal obstruction, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus. Lymphoma with pre-existing GI involvement may increase the risk of perforation. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately.\n\n**Hyperglycemia:** Serious cases, such as new-onset hyperglycemia, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis (including fatal outcomes) have been reported with ADCETRIS. Hyperglycemia occurred more frequently in patients with high body mass index or diabetes. Monitor serum glucose and if hyperglycemia develops, administer anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated.\n\n**Embryo-fetal toxicity:** Based on the mechanism of action and animal studies, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of this potential risk, and to use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for 2 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS.\n\n### ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥20% in any study) are peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, constipation, vomiting, alopecia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anemia, stomatitis, lymphopenia, mucositis, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia.\n\n### DRUG INTERACTIONS\n\nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors has the potential to affect the exposure to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Closely monitor adverse reactions.\n\n### USE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS\n\n**Lactation:** Breastfeeding is not recommended during ADCETRIS treatment.\n\n**Please see the full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING, for ADCETRIS [here](https://seagendocs.com/Adcetris_Full_Ltr_Master.pdf).** \n\n## About ADZYNMA (ADAMTS13 recombinant-krhn)\n\nADZYNMA (ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn) is a human recombinant “A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13” ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) indicated for prophylactic or on-demand enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in adult and pediatric patients with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP).\n\n### IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n**ADZYNMA is contraindicated** in patients who have experienced life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to ADZYNMA or its components.\n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Allergic-type hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur with ADZYNMA.

The trial compared FRUZAQLA plus best supportive care (BSC) with placebo plus BSC in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The FRESCO-2 trial met all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints and demonstrated consistent benefits in patients who received FRUZAQLA, regardless of the types of therapy the patients had previously received. FRUZAQLA demonstrated a manageable safety profile in the FRESCO-2 trial, with the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation being 21% in the placebo plus BSC arm compared to 20% in the FRUZAQLA plus BSC arm.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e The data from the FRESCO-2 trial were [published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00772-9/abstract) in *The Lancet* in June 2023.\n\nDr. Takayuki Yoshino, deputy director of hospital, head, Division for the Promotion of Drug and Diagnostic Development, and chief, Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology at the National Cancer Center Hospital East, who served on the FRESCO-2 study Steering Committee, said, “Although the mortality rate of colorectal cancer has been going down in recent years due to early screening and advances in treatment, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic colorectal cancer remains low and new treatment options are much in need. The approval of FRUZAQLA in Japan offers new hope for patients and families of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, as well as for healthcare personnel involved in colorectal cancer treatment. I feel that it is of great clinical significance.”\n\n“For more than a decade, Takeda has been a leader in advancing the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in Japan. With this approval of FRUZAQLA, we are able to further support patients living with this debilitating disease,” said Teresa Bitetti, president of the Global Oncology Business Unit at Takeda. “FRUZAQLA is now approved in the U.S., European Union, Japan and a number of other countries around the world, and we remain committed to bringing this treatment to additional patients with metastatic colorectal cancer around the world who urgently need new therapeutic options.”\n\n## About FRUZAQLA (fruquintinib)\n\nFRUZAQLA is a selective oral inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors (-1, -2 and -3). VEGFR inhibitors play a pivotal role in blocking tumor angiogenesis. FRUZAQLA was designed to have enhanced selectivity that limits off-target kinase activity, allowing for drug exposure achieving sustained target inhibition and flexibility for potential use as part of combination therapy.\n\nTakeda has the exclusive worldwide license to further develop, commercialize, and manufacture fruquintinib outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. FRUZAQLA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2023 and by the European Commission (EC) in June 2024. Fruquintinib is developed and marketed in China by HUTCHMED. Fruquintinib was approved for marketing by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in September 2018 and commercially launched in China in November 2018 under the brand name ELUNATE®.\n\n### JAPAN IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nPlease consult the FRUZAQLA (fruquintinib) Japan package insert (J-PI) before prescribing.\n\n**WARNING:** FRUZAQLA should be administered only to patients for whom the use of FRUZAQLA is considered appropriate under the supervision of a physician with sufficient knowledge of and experience in cancer chemotherapy at a medical institution where adequate emergency care can be provided. Prior to treatment initiation, the efficacy and risks should be fully explained to the patient and/or his/her family and informed consent should be obtained; Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including fatal cases, has been reported. Patients should be carefully monitored, and if any abnormalities are observed, administration of FRUZAQLA should be withheld and appropriate measures should be taken. If severe hemorrhage occurs, FRUZAQLA should not be re-administered; Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported with some fatal cases. Patients should be carefully monitored, and if any abnormalities are observed, administration of FRUZAQLA should be withheld and appropriate measures should be taken. If gastrointestinal perforation occurs, FRUZAQLA should not be re-administered.\n\n**CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of FRUZAQLA.\n\n**IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONS:** Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, may occur. Blood pressure should be measured prior to the initiation of FRUZAQLA treatment and periodically during this treatment; Proteinuria may occur. Urinary protein should be monitored prior to the initiation of FRUZAQLA treatment and periodically during this treatment; If a surgical procedure is to be performed, patients are recommended to withhold FRUZAQLA before the surgery because wound healing may be delayed. Treatment resumption after the surgical procedure should be determined depending on the patient's condition upon confirmation of adequate wound healing.\n\n**PRECAUTIONS CONCERNING PATIENTS WITH SPECIFIC BACKGROUNDS:** **Patients with hypertension:** Hypertension may worsen; **Patients with bleeding diathesis or abnormal coagulation system:** Hemorrhagic events may occur; **Patients with hemorrhage such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage:** Hemorrhage may be enhanced; **Patients with a complication of intra-abdominal inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, etc.:** Gastrointestinal perforation may occur; **Patients with current or a history of thromboembolism:** Transient ischaemic attack, thrombotic microangiopathy, pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, etc. may occur; **Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C):** Since FRUZAQLA is metabolized mainly in the liver, blood concentrations may be increased. There have been no clinical studies conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment; **Patients with Reproductive Potential:** Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment with FRUZAQLA and for 2 weeks after the last dose; **Pregnant Women:** FRUZAQLA can be administered to women who are or may be pregnant only if the expected therapeutic benefits outweigh the possible risks associated with this treatment. In a rat embryo-fetal toxicity study, fetal abnormalities and teratogenic effects consisting of fetal external, visceral, and skeletal malformations and visceral and skeletal variations were observed at exposure levels approximately 0.05 times the exposure level (AUC) of FRUZAQLA at the maximum clinical dose (5 mg/day); **Breast-feeding Women:** It is advisable not to breastfeed. FRUZAQLA may pass into breast milk, and infants may experience serious adverse reactions if they are ingested through breast milk; **Pediatric Use:** There have been no clinical studies conducted in pediatric patients.\n\n### ADVERSE REACTIONS:\n\nAny of the adverse reactions listed below may occur. Patients should be closely monitored, and if any such abnormalities are observed, appropriate measures should be taken, including treatment discontinuation. Clinically Significant Adverse Reactions are follows.\n\n**Hypertension:** Hypertension or hypertensive crisis may occur. If an increase in blood pressure is observed, appropriate treatment such as antihypertensive drug administration should be given as necessary, and if necessary, the dose of fruquintinib should be reduced, or fruquintinib administration should be interrupted. If severe or persistent hypertension, or hypertension that cannot be controlled by routine antihypertensive therapy occurs or if a hypertensive crisis occurs, fruquintinib administration should be discontinued; **Skin disorder:** Skin disorder including palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome and rash may occur; **Hemorrhage:** Hemorrhage including epistaxis, hematuria, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemoptysis may occur. Fatal outcomes have been reported; **Gastrointestinal perforation:** Fatal outcomes have been reported; **Arterial thromboembolic events:** Arterial thromboembolic events including transient ischemic attack and thrombotic microangiopathy may occur; **Venous thromboembolism events:** Venous thromboembolism such as pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis, and deep vein thrombosis may occur; **Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome:** If headaches, convulsions, lethargy, confusion, changes in mental function, blindness or other visual disturbances, or neurological impairment are observed, fruquintinib administration should be discontinued, and appropriate measures should be taken, including blood pressure control; **Arterial dissection:** Arterial dissection including aortic dissection may occur.\n\n***For US Prescribing Information:*** https://www.fruzaqla.com/sites/default/files/resources/fruzaqla-prescribing-information.pdf\n\n***For European Union Summary of Product Characteristics:*** https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/fruzaqla\n\n\n## About the Phase 3 FRESCO-2 Trial\n\nThe FRESCO-2 study is a multi-regional clinical trial conducted in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Australia investigating FRUZAQLA plus BSC vs placebo plus BSC in patients with previously treated mCRC ([NCT04322539](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04322539)). The study met all of its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating that treatment with FRUZAQLA resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival. The safety profile of FRUZAQLA in FRESCO-2 was consistent with previously reported fruquintinib monotherapy studies. Results from the study were [presented](https://oncologypro.esmo.org/meeting-resources/esmo-congress-2022/fresco-2-a-global-phase-iii-multiregional-clinical-trial-mrct-evaluating-the-efficacy-and-safety-of-fruquintinib-in-patients-with-refractory-met) at ESMO in September 2022 and subsequently [published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00772-9/abstract) in *The Lancet* in June 2023.\u003csup\u003e2,1\u003c/sup\u003e\n\n## Takeda’s Commitment to Colorectal Cancer in Japan\n\nCRC is the most prevalent type of cancer in Japan, with an estimated 161,000 new cases and 54,000 deaths in 2023, according to the National Cancer Center’s statistics.\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e While early-stage CRC can be surgically resected, mCRC remains an area of high unmet need with patients awaiting new treatment options, given its poor prognosis and limited treatment options.\u003csup\u003e4-8\u003c/sup\u003e For over a decade, we have contributed to the treatment of patients with late-stage CRC who have limited treatment options and to the advancement of personalized treatment through the provision of innovative medicines and the generation of relevant evidence. Moving forward, we will continue our work to treat patients with CRC and address their unmet needs.\n\n## About Takeda\n\nTakeda is focused on creating better health for people and a brighter future for the world.

Awny Farajallah, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Global Oncology Business Unit**\n\nOver the past several decades, the rapid pace of scientific advancement has catalyzed a revolution in the way we treat cancers. This has led to a stronger focus on survival outcomes, and, in some cancers, many patients are living longer on treatment than ever before thanks to therapeutic developments such as novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy. The improvement in survival rates has created an opportunity – and obligation – to consider factors beyond just survival rates when it comes to the management of the disease.\n\nAs we continue to advance treatment options, there has been a growing movement towards prioritizing patient-centered care – considering the individual health status, preferences, values, and goals of patients when making treatment decisions. Balancing clinical outcomes with the real-world experiences of patients can be complex but is necessary to provide the best possible care. \n\n## Redefining Survival: The Dramatic Impact of Targeted Therapy\n\nLet’s dive a little deeper into one of the reasons we’ve observed such notable improvements in the survival rates for certain cancer types – targeted therapies. Targeted therapies have revolutionized the way some cancers are treated by enabling us to target a genetic mutation that may be driving the cancer. This scientific achievement has dramatically changed the prognosis for certain types of cancers, such as breast and lung.\n\nFor example, breast cancer is the second-most common and lethal cancer type in women, and treatment options were previously limited to chemotherapies, radiation, and surgical procedures. For HER2-positive breast cancers specifically, which account for about 20% of all breast cancers, the disease is more aggressive and has a worse prognosis. The development of HER2-targeted drugs has forever changed the treatment approach and patient outcomes. In fact, some treatment combinations for this cancer extend survival to more than 4.5 years, compared to a life expectancy of 1.5 years achieved 14 years ago.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\n\nA similar transformation has occurred in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), another widespread cancer that has been historically difficult to treat and was previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of both. Over time, we’ve learned that about 70% of patients with NSCLC have a targetable mutation, such as EGFR, BRAF, ALK or KRAS. With improved diagnostic testing, these patients are being matched with treatments that target their cancer at its source. As a result, in recent years, population-level mortality from NSCLC has fallen sharply.\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e\n\nIn addition to longer survival durations, some targeted therapies have also improved upon the toxicity profiles and administration of standard chemotherapies. For example, in a study comparing neoadjuvant targeted therapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC, the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was found to be significantly less in the targeted therapy group compared to the chemotherapy group.\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e Many of these targeted therapies are administered orally, providing a more convenient dosing regimen for patients.\u003csup\u003e4-10\u003c/sup\u003e \n\nIn the 20+ years since the first targeted therapies for cancer were introduced, they have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer, lung cancer and many other types of cancer, and made the possibility of extending patients’ lives while improving convenience, adherence and safety, a reality.\u003csup\u003e11\u003c/sup\u003e  \n\n## From Survival to Survivorship \n\nWhile the rise in survival rates is an incredible accomplishment that will continue to be built upon as science advances, it has also brought about a paradigm shift in cancer care. With more cancer survivors living longer and more therapeutic options than ever before, there is greater impetus to evolve how we evaluate factors to identify the best treatment for each patient. \n\nFor example, quality of life (QoL) and method of treatment administration are important real-world factors that should be considered in addition to clinical outcomes, as they play a crucial role in the everyday lives and experiences of patients. \n\nThat said, how they are viewed and prioritized can differ by patient. For example, some patients may prioritize convenience and flexibility in treatment administration, while others may be more concerned about potential side effects or the impact of treatment on their ability to work or socialize. Some patients may prefer oral therapies that can be taken at home, while others may be comfortable with intravenous therapies administered in a clinical setting.\n\nEvaluating these factors alongside traditional clinical standards when determining the best possible treatment ensures we are taking not only a patient’s survival into account – but also their quality of survivorship. Survivorship, in the context of cancer, refers to the journey and life experiences patients must navigate following their cancer diagnosis. Despite advancements in care over the past decade, there are still substantial gaps and challenges that need to be addressed to alleviate the short- and long-term effects of treatments – such as fatigue, cognitive problems, and pain – and their impact on an individual’s survivorship and long-term disease management. \n\nBecause real-world factors and their role in survivorship are often not measured in randomized clinical trials, it’s crucial we invest in real-world evidence research and partner with patients and advocacy groups to understand how patients experience and prioritize factors such as location, family type, socioeconomic status, mental health, support systems, and cultural background and how these considerations influence their decisions.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to provide patients with the best possible opportunity of achieving long-term survival while also maintaining a good quality of life. This requires a collaborative effort between patients, their healthcare providers, and the healthcare industry to ensure that the unique needs and preferences of each patient are considered to improve care. \n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nWhile clinical outcomes will continue to be paramount, as treatment options improve, it is imperative that additional factors are considered, and patients are actively involved in the decision-making process.  Considering patient preferences on factors like quality of life, treatment feasibility and emotional well-being alongside considerations on clinical efficacy can help optimize outcomes and patient experience. \n\nBy prioritizing an environment of trust, shared decision-making, and open communication, we can empower individuals to actively participate in their treatment journeys and become informed partners in their own care, which has been shown to improve their perception of quality of care and conversations with physicians.\u003csup\u003e12\u003c/sup\u003e\n\nThe future of cancer treatment lies in embracing an approach that considers a complete picture of patient health, recognizing not only survival as a key outcome but also incorporating the patient's overall well-being, or survivorship. By integrating real-world factors into treatment decision-making, prioritizing patient-centered care, and fostering ongoing research, we can collectively transform the cancer survivorship landscape and, hopefully, empower individuals worldwide to lead fulfilling lives beyond their diagnosis.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Overall, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\n\nWhen people are diagnosed with later stage or more advanced CRC, it is known as metastatic CRC (mCRC).\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e When a cancer metastasizes, it means that cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e When caught early, CRC is often treatable and, in many cases, curable, speaking to the importance of screening and early detection. However, at least 20% of people are diagnosed with CRC in the metastatic stage, and about 50% of people diagnosed with localized CRC will develop metastases over the course of their disease.\u003csup\u003e4,5\u003c/sup\u003e After cancer metastasizes, treatment can become much more challenging and as a result, many people experience diminished survival outcomes and quality of life.\u003csup\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e\n\n## A Prevalent Cancer, A Lack of Support\n\nWhile CRC ranks among the most prevalent types of cancers, there are still considerable gaps in care and resources for patients, particularly for those experiencing structural challenges and barriers that impact both treatment access and survival outcomes.\n\nThe distribution of CRC and mCRC is not even across U.S. subpopulations; there is a marked difference in incidence among different racial and ethnic groups. For example, Black Americans are about 20% more likely to get CRC and about 40% more likely to die from it than any other racial group in the U.S.\u003csup\u003e7\u003c/sup\u003e Additional factors that could impact disease experience with CRC are socioeconomic status, insurance access, geography and environmental exposure, among others.\n\n\u003e There is a wealth of information available around screening and prevention of CRC, but educational resources are sparse by comparison for patients with advanced CRC. While early detection of CRC is the hope, the unfortunate truth is that many people are either diagnosed with advanced CRC or will progress to it over time. Recognizing the challenges and diverse experience of those with mCRC is not widely documented. There is a critical need to develop comprehensive resources to assist the broader community in providing better support, particularly as new treatment options and combinations emerge, offering people more decisions to navigate.\n\u003e\n\u003e **ASHLEY CALABRESE**\n\u003e Associate Director, Policy and Advocacy, US Public Affairs\n\n## A United Purpose to Support Advanced CRC Patients\n\nJoined by a passion to make a difference for advanced CRC patients, Takeda and four leading advocacy organizations are launching a U.S. survey to identify the most pressing needs concerning disease and treatment navigation. Through this collaborative effort, we intend to uncover actionable insights that will help guide the collective development of resources and education to support patients. Our partners include:\n\n**Colorectal Cancer Alliance:** Founded 25 years ago by more than 40 CRC survivors, caregivers and friends, the Alliance advocates for screening, magnifies patient support and accelerates research. It exists to end CRC in our lifetime.\n\n**COLONTOWN:** Founded by a CRC survivor looking to create a disease-specific community, COLONTOWN empowers proactive colorectal cancer patients and caregivers with educational tools and relevant peer-to-peer support.\n\n**BLKHLTH:** BLKHLTH is an Atlanta-based non-profit with a mission to advance the health of Black communities through equity-centered education, advocacy, research and programs.\n\n**Family Reach:** Family Reach is a non-profit that provides non-medical financial support to people facing cancer. They work with patients, providers and community organizations to challenge the systems that force families to choose between their health and their home.\n\nWe will be unveiling findings for the survey throughout 2024. To learn more about our partners we are collaborating with, please visit their channels: [Colorectal Cancer Alliance](https://colorectalcancer.org/), [COLONTOWN](https://colontown.org/), [BLKHLTH](https://www.blkhlth.com/) and [Family Reach](https://familyreach.org/).\n\n## References\n\n1.

Through personal and professional conversations with patients, we also recognize that their challenges often extend far beyond the initial diagnosis.\n\nFrom financial and job insecurity, to depression and anxiety, to caregiving responsibilities – cancer treatment can be all-consuming. And while developing innovative medicines to treat cancer is at the heart of what we do as a pharmaceutical company, there is a lesser-known part as critical as the medicine – treating the whole patient. It’s this care beyond medicine where we have devoted more support in recent years.\n\n## Mental Health and Well-Being\n\nA cancer diagnosis can take an incredible toll on mental and emotional health, and recognizing changes in mood and behavior are critical during the journey according to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/side-effects/emotional-mood-changes.html). Approximately 35% of patients diagnosed with cancer are impacted by a psychiatric disorder, and another 20% experience clinically relevant distressing psychosocial conditions such as demoralization and health anxiety.\u003csup\u003e1 \u003c/sup\u003eResearch has shown that cancer patients receiving mental health support have better outcomes.\u003csup\u003e2 \u003c/sup\u003eUnfortunately, while mental health support may be a key part of a patient’s treatment journey, it is not always incorporated.\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e\n\nFortunately, there are several ways patients can be supported as they navigate the physical and emotional aspects of cancer. I am impressed by the resources that many of our partner patient advocacy organizations such as [CancerCare](https://www.cancercare.org/) provide – including emotional, practical and financial support – to navigate resources and the underlying emotions associated with diagnosis and treatment.\n\n## Life Necessities and Obligations\n\nA cancer diagnosis does not put life on pause. Patients may still need to feed themselves (and also family members), keep a roof over their heads, continue working, among many other aspects of life. Cancer is stressful enough without the added component of determining how to afford life.\n\nFinancial hardship impacts one in three patients diagnosed with cancer. And the risks disproportionality affect those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and working-aged patients.\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e The anxiety and stress of affording basic necessities can lead to poorer mental health, which can lead to poorer outcomes, perpetuating a vicious cycle. Fortunately, organizations such as [Family Reach](https://familyreach.org/) provide resources to help patients navigate non-medical expenses. No one should have to make the decision to put treatment on hold to keep food on their table or the lights on at home.\n\nIn addition, patients may also be caregivers – to children, to aging parents, to pets – a role that does not disappear at cancer diagnosis. Caregiving can be emotionally and physically taxing even without managing a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Organizations such as [Cancer Support Community](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/) offer resources to support dialogue between patient and those in their care as they navigate this journey together.\n\nCancer treatment is more than medicine. It’s the collaboration and commitment of many stakeholders to ensure that patients receive the care necessary to navigate their journey. At Takeda, I’m proud we partner with patient organizations around the globe – to raise awareness and provide support to help ensure the whole patient is being treated. This is the way we will truly reach our aspiration to cure cancer.\n\n## References:\n\n1.  Caruso R, Breitbart W. Mental health care in oncology.
